		<p>The old and cramped prison system in England and Wales was at high risk of becoming a coronavirus hotspot.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="second_page_body">
		<p>Overcrowding and Victorian buildings make social distancing almost impossible, adult prisoners tend to have poor physical and mental health and in the last two decades, the proportion of older prisoners has increased significantly.</p>

		<p>Even before the pandemic, the House of Commons Justice Committee had said the prison system was in a ‘crisis of safety and decency’.</p>

		<p>Since 2012, violent incidents have risen sharply in England and Wales. In the 12 months to March 2020, an average week saw one prisoner commit suicide and thousands of incidents of assault and self-harm.</p>

		<p>Overcrowding, where prisoners had to share cells designed for one person, ranged from 22% to 47% of the prison population. In local prisons, where a person is detained before a trial or directly after a conviction, the overcrowding rate was 47%.</p>

		<p>“The grossly underfunded and overcrowded prison system was very vulnerable to an outbreak of infection, and that hasn't changed,” says Peter Dawson, ex-governor and director of the Prison Reform Trust.</p>

		<p>In this context, serious concerns were expressed about how prisons would cope with the first wave of the pandemic.</p>

		<p>At the end of April 2020, Public Health England suggested that in a worst-case scenario, 77,800 prisoners could become infected, 4,500 hospitalised and 2,700 die if nothing was done.</p>

		<p>“How can you socially distance in an environment like this?” says Nick Hardwick, Professor of Criminal Justice at Royal Holloway University and former Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales.</p>

		<p>“You would think these are the perfect environment for the virus to spread and the population who would be vulnerable to it. For this reason, when the virus struck, the predictions about what would happen, predictions I shared, were dire,” Hardwick says. </p>

		<p>Yet outcomes were far better than projected in the first wave of the pandemic —but at a high price to pay.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="third_page_body">
		<p>By the end of August, there had been 27 deaths of prisoners where they either tested positive for Covid-19 or it was thought to be a contributory factor.</p>

		<p> During the peak of the first wave in April 2020, the community accounted for a higher death rate than prisons — 35 in 100,000 in the general population and 52 in 100,000 in prisons.</p>

		<p> The rate of infection was slightly higher in prisons during the spring peak, with a rate of 384 in 100,000 in prisons and 212 in 100,000 in the community.</p>

		<p> As in the general population, older prisoners appeared most at risk from the virus but unlike in the general population, prisoners from black, Asian and other ethnic groups did not appear to be disproportionately affected in the data published to date.</p>

		<p> “Although infection rates have been higher than in the community, it has not been nearly as dramatically as people expected, but that's because a staggeringly high percentage of prisoners have spent almost all of the last 12 months confined to a cell for almost all of every day to a completely unprecedented degree,” Dawson says.</p>

		<p> A day after the United Kingdom went into its first national lockdown on 23 March 2020, it was announced that all prisoners were to spend most of the day in their cells.</p>

		<p> Infected prisoners were isolated. Work, education and rehabilitation activities were almost completely halted and visits from family or friends were stopped.</p>

		<p> Although prisons were 97% full at the start of lockdown, with 83,000 prisoners, numbers started to fall due to ordinary releases and a slowdown in new arrivals caused by slower or suspended court proceedings. </p>

		<p>In the second wave, the virus spread much faster than in the community and many prisoners did not survive.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fourth_page_body">
		<p>After a summer free of Covid-19 prison deaths, the data started to head into the wrong direction as the second wave of the pandemic hit Britain in the autumn.</p>

		<p>In the second wave, a better prepared prison service strengthened control measures. There was an increase in routine testing of staff, reception testing of prisoners, mass testing during outbreaks and a wastewater testing pilot.</p>

		<p>But prisoners kept getting sick. Infections rose more rapidly across the prisoner population than they did across the general population in England and Wales. By January, there were close to 2,000 cases per 100,000 in the UK, while the rate inside prisons was over 6,000 cases per 100,000.</p>

		<p>In the first three months of this year, 72 prisoners died from the disease in England and Wales. February 2021 was the deadliest month since the start of the pandemic, registering 32 deaths.</p>

		<p>“In the first wave, quite a lot of prisoners managed to avoid infection altogether remarkably,” Dawson says. “Most prisons have had an outbreak in the second one. I think that probably has to do with the nature of the virus, which like in the community, it appears that new variants have spread much more easily.”</p>

		<p>The government’s scientific advisors, the SAGE committee, said the higher rate in prisons might be explained by variants like the B117 strain or by “a degree of fatigue with control measures”.</p>

		<p>Strict lockdowns didn’t stop some prisons from being overwhelmed with infections.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>Our analysis of Ministry of Justice data from March 2020 to January 2021 shows that in HMP Brixton, London, over half of prisoners were infected with Covid-19, followed by HMP North Sea Camp in Lincolnshire where over 2 in 5 were infected.</p>

		<p>“The situation at Brixton was bad,” remembers David, who spent several months there last year after being transferred from HMP Sutton. “So many prisoners got sick, doctors were everywhere and I could hear ambulances all the time.”</p>

		<p>In HMP Cardiff, a third of the roughly 800 prisoners contracted Covid-19. Social distancing was a formidable hurdle in a structure built in 1832.</p>

		<p>“Although temporary accommodation has been introduced in some sites to reduce the number of prisoners sharing cells, there isn’t any at Cardiff [prison] because there is not enough space outside,” says Sarah Rigby, the Prison Officer Association’s South West and South Wales area representative.</p>
		
		<p>Covid-19 meant prisons in England and Wales had a record number of staff absences from April to October 2020.</p>

		<p>“Cardiff for a while had about 14 prison officers from Swansea drafted in to support them for three to four weeks,” says Rigby. “This is good but also alien to the concept that you shouldn't be bringing new people from a different area into the prison.”</p>

	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>Within two weeks of the start of lockdown, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland announced a plan to release thousands of low-risk prisoners. In the end, only a few hundred were let out before the plan was abandoned at the end of the summer.</p>

		<!-- ######   VIZ_4   ##### -->

		<p>“The Early Release Scheme was bound to fail from the start,” Dawson says. “No one when they saw the scheme as it was written expected that it would produce anything like 4,000 releases because that would have been politically unwelcome.”</p>

		<p>“I think the answer to why it hasn't been restarted in the second wave is that prison numbers have fallen due to the courts not operating normally,” says Dawson.</p>

		<p>“There hasn't been either the death rate or the incidence of disorder within prisons that ministers were worried about when they finally agreed to set up a scheme in the first place, but both of those seem to me to be wholly inadequate reasons,” he says. </p>

		<p>With twenty-three hours a day to ponder thoughts in their cells, campaigners believe this could have dangerous long-term impacts on the mental health of inmates.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>Although the restrictions have saved thousands of lives, surveys have indicated that spending up to 23 hours a day in a cell, stopping visits from spouses, children and partners, as well as the cancellation of rehabilitative activities has had a substantial negative impact on mental health.</p>

		<p>“The most disturbing effect of the restrictions was the decline in prisoners’ emotional, psychological and physical well-being,” said Charlie Taylor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons in a report from last February.</p>

		<p>“They were chronically bored and exhausted by spending hours locked in their cells. They described being drained, depleted, lacking in purpose and sometimes resigned to their situation,” he said.</p>

		<p>Taylor said that prisoners’ mental and physical health were, sometimes visibly, in decline, and that their despondency, resentment and lack of hope for the future were especially notable.   “Some said they were using unhealthy coping strategies, including self-harm and drugs, while others reported using mundane routines to pass the time and cope with their confinement and associated anxieties,” Taylor said. “They frequently compared themselves to caged animals. As one prisoner said: ‘It’s like being imprisoned while you’re in prison’.”</p>

		<p>Public Health England stopped in-person visits at prisons in England and Wales on 24 March last year without exception until 6 July, when some prisons were able to reopen under strict guidelines. However, some prisoners were not able to receive visits until September or later. HMP Leicester did not reopen until 26 October, just 11 days before it was locked down again.</p>

		<p>Research from the University of Oxford has estimated that more than 300,000 children in England and Wales have a parent in prison each year, and many of these children have not had any face-to-face contact with their parent since early March 2020.</p>

		<p>At the time of writing, from 29 March 2021 English and Welsh prisons where infection levels are ‘under control’ have been able to resume social visits for the first time in almost four months.</p>

		<p>Strengthening relationships with their family and friends can support prisoners’ successful release back into the community and reduce the likelihood of further offending. The Inspectorate of Prisons said prisoners found the lack of visits from their families for months at a time difficult to cope with.</p>

		<p>However, the new introduction of free video calling, and the continuing installation of in-cell phones were valued by prisoners, the Inspectorate said.</p>

		<p>“Prisoners have seen drastic changes to their daily routines to save lives and to protect local health services,” said Prisons Minister Lucy Frazer in a statement last January. “Part of that has been the loss of social visits – something we know plays a huge role in prisoners’ wellbeing and rehabilitation and these calls are allowing them to keep this vital family contact.”</p>

		<p>Self-harm rates decreased in male prisons after a decade of an upward trend.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>In the 12 months to March 2021, 79 prisoners took their own lives, a 4% decrease from the 82 self-inflicted deaths in the previous 12 months. When it comes to self-harm, there were 55,542 incidents from 11,843 individuals in the 12 months to December 2020, down 13% from the previous year, comprising a 16% decrease in men’s prisons.</p>

		<p>Self-harm among women prisoners, however, increased slightly by 0.5% from 11,931 incidents from 1,279 individuals in 2019 to 11,988 from 1,215 individuals in 2020.</p>

		<p>However, Dawson suggests these figures could not represent the real picture as incidents might have been underreported. “If you look at how self-harm incidents are recorded in prisons normally, a significant percentage of them are recorded by teachers, psychologists, volunteers, prisoner peer workers, and they haven't been going in,” Dawson says. “I think we don’t understand what’s actually been happening.”</p>

		<p>“The week leading up to Easter I had a period of depression and had seriously considered harming myself,” a prisoner told the Prison Reform Trust last June. “Staff here were completely unaware and it wasn’t until my concerned mother phoned the prison any action was taken.”</p>

		<p>David, however, remembers staff checking up on him on a regular basis. “There were days when I didn’t eat and all I did was sleep,” he says. “Officers worried about my mental health and would ask me if I was okay or if I needed to see a doctor.”</p>

		<p>Andrew Forrester, a professor of forensic psychiatry at Cardiff University that has done extensive research on mental health in the criminal justice system, says that many prisoners might be suffering in silence.</p>

		<p>“A problem in prison is that it can be difficult for people to know what is going on,” he says. “A lot of prisoners are suffering in silence but not telling anybody about it, which makes it difficult to judge the full extent of problems they have.”</p>

		<p>Last year, there were 34% less assaults than the year before, dropping from 32,800 incidents in 2019 to 21,489 in 2020. There were 13,784 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults in the 12 months to December, 41% less than the year before, and 7,979 assaults on staff, a reduction of 20% from 2019.</p>

		<p>“In a prison setting where there are problems with gang activity, coercion and threatening behaviour, the strengthened control lockdown posed might have had an effect on self harm rates,” says Forrester.</p>

		<p>“It may be that things were so bad that the restriction or regimes made an appalling situation slightly less appalling,” Dawson says.</p>

		<p>However, prisoners told HM Inspectorate of Prisons that violence, intimidation and bullying had not stopped, but had instead taken other forms.</p>

		<p>“The accrual of debt persisted, and some had turned to using drugs as a way of managing their isolation and boredom,” the Inspectorate said. They believed the current restrictions could not last indefinitely and were therefore worried about a future resurgence in physical assaults.</p>

		<p>Lockdown restrictions left prisoners with fewer opportunities for rehabilitation.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>Education and training in prisons plays a key role in improving the employability of prisoners, which in turn reduces the chances of reoffending. However, lockdown conditions in prisons effectively ended opportunities for inmates to take part in rehabilitation activities and progress in their sentences.</p>

		<p>“We have not been able to properly train any of our students throughout the past year, and when restrictions have eased and prisons have allowed our students to take part in training, we have soon after had to lockdown again,” says The Clink Charity, an organisation which aims to cut reoffending by providing hospitality training to prisoners.</p>

		<p>With opportunities for prisoners to attend education classes or training paused in most prisons, the focus on helping them address their offending behaviour or reduce their risk of serious harm to others had largely been lost.</p>

		<p>“The prospect of release into a world drastically different as a result of Covid-19 restrictions caused them significant anxiety,” the Inspectorate said.</p>

		<p>“A key aim of imprisonment is rehabilitating the offender so that they're able to return to society and live a productive and meaningful useful life subsequently,” Forrester says. “What’s the use of imprisonment without rehabilitation? I think it's vital that we reassess rehabilitation, as soon as we are out of the pandemic and beyond.”</p>

		<p>“The opportunity as a prisoner to show that you can be trusted and that you are taking a constructive approach to your prison time has all disappeared,” says Dawson. “This will certainly mean fewer people getting released when they should.”</p>

		<p>Incarcerated people have not been given priority to be inoculated, though they have an elevated risk of infection and death.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>Despite numerous calls by charities and authoritative voices in the scientific community, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decided that unlike care homes, prisons would not be prioritised for the jab, stating that all vaccinations would be appropriately distributed by age groups rather than those most at risk of infection.</p>

		<p>Last March, a University College London (UCL)-led team of researchers also called for the prison population to be made a vaccine priority. They suggested that people in prisons are at an increased risk of Covid-19 - with a death rate over three times higher than that of the general population.</p>

		<p>A SAGE report on Covid-19 transmissibility in prisons said that vaccination of all prisoners would have a similar impact to the current highly intensive control measures and that vaccination of staff would also decrease infection levels.</p>

		<p>“This suggests that severe restrictions could be lifted much quicker if the vaccine is rolled out faster than currently planned under the current prioritisation criteria,” the report read.</p>

		<p>“Universal vaccination for prisoners and staff as a priority group would provide a strong defence against that and reduce or avoid the need for the measures that do so much damage to mental health and the prospects for successful resettlement,” says Dawson.</p>

		<p>“If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation agrees with SAGE, it’s hard to see any possible reason for the government not to take the advice,” he says.</p>

		<p>As the backlog in the courts is reduced, prisoner occupancy levels will rise and maintaining the current control measures will become troublesome. “It’s going to go down like a wave and hit prisons,” Hardwick says. “I’m really worried about the effect of that.” </p>

		<p>Although the future is uncertain, many are hopeful that the prison service will rebuild better and stronger.</p>

	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>Although efforts to contain the spread of the virus were initially successful, they have come at a heavy cost to prisoners. The long-term effect of the absence of rehabilitation and being locked up for over 22 hours every day, often without company, is likely to be significant and far-reaching.</p>

		<p>The Inspectorate called into question whether the right balance had been achieved between managing the risk posed by Covid-19 and providing prisoners with enough meaningful activity, engagement and time out of cell.</p>

		<p>“Many prisoners feared being released with increased mental health problems and without having had the chance to address their offending behaviour,” the Inspectorate said.</p>

		<p>In the midst of the profound impact this crisis is likely to have on prisoners in the long run, and with opportunities such as a whole-prison approach to vaccinations and an effective early release scheme being missed, people familiar with the current prison system say that the post-pandemic ‘new normal’ could be a catalyst for change.</p>

		<p>“The pandemic is exacerbating existing social, economic and health inequalities,” says Nicola Padfield, Professor in Criminal and Penal Justice and Director of the Cambridge Centre for Criminal Justice. “This is an opportunity to challenge the perpetuation of a really expensive and ineffective system.”</p>

		<p>“We need to reflect very carefully about what has happened,” says Hardwick. “It may be that we won’t be able to understand it for some time, but I certainly think that there is an opportunity to change. We can’t just go back to the appalling situation that there was before. We can’t go back to that level of violence.”</p>

		<p>As the prison service rebuilds after the pandemic, there is hope that conversations about how to lay a vision for a safer prison community will be held.</p>

		<p>“Is it a moment for change? It might be, crisis often is,” says Dawson. “The optimists will say, well, the National Health Service was created during the Second World War.” </p>
