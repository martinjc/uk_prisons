	<div class="first_page_body">
		<p>It is difficult to think of an institution that appeared more at risk from Covid-19 than prisons. Many prisons in England and Wales are overcrowded, Victorian buildings make social distancing almost impossible, and much of its population is physically and mentally vulnerable. Although the prison population is generally younger than the population as a whole, older prisoners are its most rapidly growing age group. 
		</p>
		<p>Moreover, a disproportionately large part of the population is made up of prisoners recorded as being from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups, which in the community appear particularly at risk from Covid-19. 
		</p>
		<p>But even before the pandemic, the situation in prisons was far from ideal. In October 2019, the House of Commons Justice Committee described the UK prison system as being in the midst of an ‘enduring crisis of safety and decency’.</p>
		<p>Data from the Ministry of Justice shows that since 2012, assaults and self-harm had risen sharply. In the 12 months to March 2020, there were 80 self-inflicted deaths, 63,328 self-harm incidents, 32,669 assaults and 9,995 assaults on staff. </p>
		<p>Twenty-two per cent of the prison population was held in overcrowded conditions, sharing cells designed for one. In local prisons, the overcrowding rate was 47%, with 32% of adult men in these prisons reporting that they spent just two hours a day or less out of their cells.</p>
		<p>“The grossly underfunded and overcrowded prison system was very vulnerable to an outbreak of infection, and that hasn't changed,” says Peter Dawson, ex-governor and director of the Prison Reform Trust.</p>
		<p>In this context and despite signs that the data was beginning to turn in the right direction in the months prior to the pandemic, serious concerns were expressed about how prisons would cope with the first wave of the pandemic.</p>

		<p>“How can you socially distance in an environment like this?” says Nick Hardwick, Professor of Criminal Justice at Royal Holloway University and former Chief Inspector of Prisons for England and Wales. </p>

		<p> “You would think these are the perfect environment for which the virus to spread and the population who would be vulnerable to it. For this reason, when the virus struck, the predictions about what would happen, predictions I shared, were dire,” Hardwick says. </p>

		<p>An early estimate by University College London indicated that 800 prisoners could die if no action was taken. At the end of April 2020, Public Health England suggested that in a reasonable worst-case scenario, 77,800 prisoners could become infected, 4,500 hospitalised and 2,700 die if nothing was done. </p>

		<p>With strict regime changes, shielding of the most vulnerable and cohorting, PHE said that these numbers could be brought down to 2,800, 200 and 100 respectively. </p>

	<h1 class="body_title">The First Wave</h1>
	<div class="third_page_body">
		<p>Yet in the first wave of the pandemic, outcomes were far better than projected. By the end of August, there had been 27 deaths of prisoners where they either tested positive for Covid-19 or it was thought to be a contributory factor in their death, with 17 of them occurring in April.</p>

		<p>During the peak of the first wave in April 2020, the community accounted for a higher death rate than prisons &mdash; 35 in 100,000 and 52 in 100,000 respectively. When it comes to cases, the rate of infection was slightly higher in prisons during the spring peak, with a rate of 384 in 100,000 in prisons and 212 in 100,000 in the community.</p>

		<p>As in the general population, older prisoners appeared most at risk from the virus but unlike in the general population, prisoners from black, Asian and other ethnic groups did not appear to be disproportionately affected in the data published to date.</p>

	<div class="fourth_page_body">
		<p>&ldquo;Although infection rates have been higher than the community, it has not been nearly as dramatically as people expected, but that's because a staggeringly high percentage of prisoners have spent almost all of the last 12 months confined to a cell for almost all of every day to a completely unprecedented degree,&rdquo; Dawson says.</p>

		<p>A day after the United Kingdom went into its first national lockdown on 23 March 2020, it was announced that all prisoners were to spend most of the day in their cells, work, education and rehabilitation activities were almost completely halted and visits from family or friends were stopped.</p>

		<p>The new rules were complemented by the establishment of a compartmentalisation strategy or 'cohorting' which included Protective Isolation Units to accommodate confirmed or probable Covid-19 cases, Shielding Units to protect the most vulnerable and Reverse Cohorting Units to accommodate new receptions or transfers for a period of 14 days.</p>

		<p>At a time when the prison estate was at 97% of its operational capacity for population, with over 83,052 prisoners in March 2020, reducing the numbers was essential for the implementation of any strategy of that kind to work.</p>

		<p>By September, the prison population had fallen almost 5% to 79,138. At the time of writing in April 2021, 78,081 people are incarcerated in England and Wales.</p>

		<p>Since the onset of the pandemic, the prison population has been reduced largely due to ordinary prison releases and the significantly fewer number of new receptions into prison due to the suspension of court processes. </p>

		<h2><span>A Deadlier Second Wave</span></h2>
	</div>
	<h1 class="body_title">A Deadlier Second Wave</h1>
	<div class="fifth_page_body">
		<p>After a summer free of Covid-19 deaths in prisons, at the start of autumn of 2020 the data started to head into the wrong direction as the second wave of the pandemic hit Britain.</p>

		<p>In the second wave, a better prepared prison service strengthened control measures. There was an increase in routine testing of staff, reception testing of prisoners, mass testing during outbreaks and a wastewater testing pilot.  Despite this, the incidence of the disease, number and size of outbreaks, hospitalisation and mortality rates increased markedly compared to the first wave, as also observed in the community.</p>

		<p>From October to December 2020, 44 Covid-19 related deaths among prisoners were recorded. In the first three months of 2021, 72 people died from the disease in prisons in England and Wales. February 2021 was the deadliest month since the start of the pandemic, registering 32 Covid-19 related deaths.</p>

		<p>In the 12 months to 31st March 2021, 143 prisoners have died as a result of Covid-19, with 81% of deaths occurring in the second wave of the pandemic. The rate of Covid-19 related deaths in the England and Wales community has remained higher than in prisons during both waves, however.</p>

		<p>Total deaths in prison custody including suicide, homicide and natural causes increased by 42% in the year to March 2021, with a record total of 154 deaths in the first three months of the year. This has been driven by deaths related to Covid-19, the Ministry of Justice said.</p>

		<p>When it comes to infections, the difference with the community was significant. Data shows that coronavirus infections rose more rapidly across the prisoner population during the second wave than they did across the general population in England and Wales. In January 2021, the Covid-19 case rate in the general population reached 1,882 in 100,000, while the rate of infection in prisons was 6,294 in 100,000.</p>

		<p>&ldquo;In the first wave, quite a lot of prisoners managed to avoid infection altogether remarkably,&rdquo; Dawson says. &ldquo;Most prisons have had an outbreak in the second one. I think that probably has to do with the nature of the virus, which like in the community, it appears that new variants have spread much more easily.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>A March 2021 report from the SAGE committee, the government&rsquo;s scientific advisors on Covid-19, said that the significantly higher impact of the disease in prisons during the second wave &ldquo;may reflect increased transmissibility due to the B.1.17 strain, higher community incidence and potentially a degree of fatigue with control measures&rdquo;.</p>

		<p>There is no available official Covid-19 testing in prisons data as of yet, but we asked the Ministry of Justice to provide it through a Freedom of Information request sent last March. We are still awaiting a response.</p>
