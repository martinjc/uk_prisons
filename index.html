		<p>It is difficult to think of an institution that appeared more at risk from Covid-19 than prisons. Many prisons in England and Wales are overcrowded, Victorian buildings make social distancing almost impossible, and much of its population is physically and mentally vulnerable. Although the prison population is generally younger than the population as a whole, older prisoners are its most rapidly growing age group. 
		</p>
		<p>Moreover, a disproportionately large part of the population is made up of prisoners recorded as being from black, Asian and other minority ethnic groups, which in the community appear particularly at risk from Covid-19. 
		</p>
		<p>But even before the pandemic, the situation in prisons was far from ideal. In October 2019, the House of Commons Justice Committee described the UK prison system as being in the midst of an ‘enduring crisis of safety and decency’.</p>
		<p>Data from the Ministry of Justice shows that since 2012, assaults and self-harm had risen sharply. In the 12 months to March 2020, there were 80 self-inflicted deaths, 63,328 self-harm incidents, 32,669 assaults and 9,995 assaults on staff. </p>
		<p>Twenty-two per cent of the prison population was held in overcrowded conditions, sharing cells designed for one. In local prisons, the overcrowding rate was 47%, with 32% of adult men in these prisons reporting that they spent just two hours a day or less out of their cells.</p>
		<p>“The grossly underfunded and overcrowded prison system was very vulnerable to an outbreak of infection, and that hasn't changed,” says Peter Dawson, ex-governor and director of the Prison Reform Trust.</p>
		<p>In this context and despite signs that the data was beginning to turn in the right direction in the months prior to the pandemic, serious concerns were expressed about how prisons would cope with the first wave of the pandemic.</p>
